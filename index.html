		 Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. 
		 That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know,
		 everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever 
		 was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy
		 and suffering, thousands of confident religions, 
		 ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and 
		 forager, every hero and coward, every creator and 
		 destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, 
		 every young couple in love, every mother and father, 
		 hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher
		 of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar,
		 " every "supreme leader,every saint and sinner in 
		 the history of our species lived there-on a mote of
		 dust suspended in a sunbeam.

		 Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious.
